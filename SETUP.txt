# This file assumes you are reading it, and copying and pasting the commands in a terminal
# Do not do this as root, it will mess up permissions and be a pain in the ass.
# Run with sudo as a user.

# This guide has been broken down into sections incase you only want to build certain things, rather than the entire stack.
# You may see repeats of "wgets" and "apt installs" in those sections

# SSL Setup #
#############

# We wish to do this BEFORE creating our IRC/html
# Will make life EAISER
# If we setup SSL first, everything will use it later by DEFAULT

# Let's create a SSL certificate, will take a while
openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 4096;

# Make dir for ssl tests
mkdir -p /var/lib/letsencrypt/.well-known;
chgrp www-data /var/lib/letsencrypt;
chmod g+s /var/lib/letsencrypt;

# Move files from repo to directories

# conf
mv /home/Our_VPS/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.conf /etc/nginx/snippets;
# website conf
mv /home/Our_VPS/letsencrypt/anonymousoperators.com /etc/nginx/sites-available;
# ssl conf
mv /home/Our_VPS/letsencrypt/ssl.conf /etc/nginx/snippets;


# symbolic link
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/anonymousoperators.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/;


# restart nginx
systemctl restart nginx;

# SSL test
certbot certonly --agree-tos --email anonymousoperators@tutanota.com --webroot -w /var/lib/letsencrypt/ -d anonymousoperators.com -d www.anonymousoperators.com;

# remove the old conf, mv the new conf, rename it

# NOW LET'S SET SSL TO AUTO-RENEW SO WE DON'T HAVE TO REDO THIS FUCKING SHIT
# move certbot file
mv /home/Our_VPS/letsencrypt/certbot /etc/cron.d/;

# dry run, if no errors, 100% successful
certbot renew --dry-run;


#Now your got your domain setup with ssl, nginx is installed. Let's setup IRC.
